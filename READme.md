Here is a suitable `README.md` for your Streamlit crash severity prediction app:

```markdown
# Crash Severity Prediction App

This Streamlit web application predicts whether a crash will be **severe (1)** or **not severe (0)** based on selected time-related features using a Logistic Regression model.

## Features Used
- `crash_hour`
- `crash_month`
- `HOUR`
- `MINUTE`
- `is_night`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or copy the project files.

2. Make sure the following model artifacts are present under the `archive` directory:
   - `logistic_regression_model.pkl` (trained Logistic Regression model)
   - `minmax_scaler.pkl` (fitted MinMaxScaler)
   - `features.pkl` (list of features used by the model)

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy
   ```

## Running the App

Start the Streamlit app by running:

```
streamlit run crash-severity-app.py
```

The app will open in a browser where you can adjust input features in the sidebar and click **Predict** to see severity predictions and class probabilities.

## Usage

- Use the sliders and selectors on the sidebar to input the crash-related feature values.
- Click the **Predict** button to get the model prediction.
- The main page displays the input features and prediction results.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Streamlit app UI and prediction code.
- `archive/` - Contains model and scaler artifacts, and any dataset CSV files.
- Other scripts (if present) manage data preprocessing, training, and evaluation separately.

## Notes

- The app excludes the `MAX_SEV` feature during prediction to avoid data leakage.
- The model uses time-based features and a binary flag for night crash.
- Prediction output includes the predicted class (`0` or `1`) and the class probabilities.

# Crash Severity Prediction App

This Streamlit web application predicts whether a crash will be **severe (1)** or **not severe (0)** based on selected time-related features using a Logistic Regression model.

## Features Used
- `crash_hour`
- `crash_month`
- `HOUR`
- `MINUTE`
- `is_night`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or copy the project files.

2. Ensure the following files exist in the `archive` directory:
   - `logistic_regression_model.pkl` (the trained Logistic Regression model)
   - `minmax_scaler.pkl` (the fitted MinMaxScaler)
   - `features.pkl` (list of features used by the model)

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy
   ```

## Running the App

Execute the following command in your terminal:
```
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the app in your default browser.

## Usage

- Use the sidebar sliders and selectors to input feature values.
- Click the **Predict** button to get the crash severity prediction.
- The main area displays your input features and the predicted class along with class probabilities.

## Notes

- The app does not use the `MAX_SEV` feature for prediction to avoid data leakage.
- Predictions are binary: `0` for not severe, `1` for severe crashes.
- Model artifacts must be correctly placed in the `archive` directory relative to the app.
